# Project Euler

## Why

I have decided to get a **One Percenter** award on [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net).

This does not mean that I am only focused on solving as many tasks, as I can.
Of course, I am also interested in complicated problems, which may take a lot of time.

## What

This repository is used to keep track of my solutions.

If you (by occasion) are a member of the community, think twice before going to `solutions` folder.

## Current stats:

_This section will be updated regularly..._

-   **Solved:** 7
-   **Total:** 727
